# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

## üöÄ Overview
This guide will help you set up Google Sheets integration for your Employee Training Dashboard, allowing you to pull data directly from Google Sheets instead of uploading CSV files.

## üìã Prerequisites
- A Google account with access to Google Sheets
- Your employee training data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet
- Basic familiarity with Google Apps Script

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheets

1. **Open your Google Sheets** with employee training data
2. **Ensure your data has proper headers** in the first row, such as:
   - `employee_code`
   - `employee_name`
   - `department`
   - `course_name`
   - `course_completion_status`
   - `course_completion_hours`
   - `course_progress`
   - `date_of_joining`
   - `Store ID` (optional, for advanced analytics)

3. **Create a Store Mapping sheet** (optional):
   - Sheet name: `Store_Mapping`
   - Columns: `Store ID`, `location`, `Region`, `AM`, `Trainer`

### Step 2: Set Up Google Apps Script

1. **In your Google Sheets, go to:**
   ```
   Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
   ```

2. **Delete any existing code** in the script editor

3. **Copy and paste** the entire content from `google-apps-script.js` (provided in your project files)

4. **Update the CONFIG section** at the top of the script:
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
     // Change this to match your actual sheet name
     DATA_SHEET_NAME: 'Employee_Training_Data',
     
     // Change this if you have a store mapping sheet
     STORE_MAPPING_SHEET_NAME: 'Store_Mapping',
     
     // Add your frontend URLs here
     ALLOWED_ORIGINS: [
       'http://localhost:3012',
       'https://yourdomain.com'  // Add your production domain
     ]
   };
   ```

5. **Save the project** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

6. **Give your project a name** (click "Untitled project" at the top)

### Step 3: Test the Script

1. **Run the setup function:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, select `setupScript` from the function dropdown
   - Click the ‚ñ∂ Run button
   - Grant necessary permissions when prompted

2. **Check the execution log:**
   - Go to View ‚Üí Execution Transcript
   - Verify that your sheets are detected and data is readable

### Step 4: Deploy as Web App

1. **Click Deploy ‚Üí New Deployment**

2. **Choose settings:**
   - Type: **Web app**
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone** (required for your React app to access it)

3. **Click Deploy**

4. **Copy the deployment URL** - it will look like:
   ```
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
   ```

5. **Important:** Save this URL - you'll need it for the frontend!

### Step 5: Configure Frontend

1. **Add the URL to your environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # In your .env.local file
   GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
   ```

2. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 6: Test the Integration

1. **Open your React dashboard**
2. **Click "Connect Google Sheets"** tab
3. **Paste your deployment URL**
4. **Click "Test Connection"**
5. **If successful, click "Load Data from Sheets"**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### ‚ùå "Script not found" or 404 errors
- Ensure your deployment URL is correct
- Make sure the web app is deployed with "Anyone" access
- Try redeploying the script

#### ‚ùå "Permission denied" errors
- Check that the script execution permission is set to "Me"
- Ensure you've granted all required permissions
- Try running the `setupScript` function again

#### ‚ùå "Sheet not found" errors
- Verify your sheet names in the CONFIG section match your actual Google Sheets tab names
- Check for extra spaces or special characters in sheet names

#### ‚ùå Data format issues
- Ensure your first row contains proper column headers
- Check that date fields are in a consistent format
- Verify numeric fields don't contain text

### Testing Commands:

You can test your setup using these Apps Script functions:

```javascript
// Test basic connectivity
setupScript()

// Test data fetching
testScript()
```

## üîÑ Updating Data

Once set up, your dashboard will always pull the latest data from Google Sheets. Simply:

1. Update your Google Sheets with new data
2. Refresh your dashboard
3. Click "Load Data from Sheets" to get the latest information

## üîí Security Notes

- The Apps Script runs with your Google account permissions
- Only people with the deployment URL can access your data
- Consider using a dedicated Google account for production deployments
- Regularly review your Apps Script execution logs

## üìä Data Format Examples

### Employee Training Data Sheet:
```
employee_code | employee_name | department | course_name | course_completion_status | date_of_joining
